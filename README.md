# comind

This is the primary frontend for {comind}, a platform for thinking stuff together.



The app is written in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), a cross-platform
framework for building mobile apps.

## Prerequisites

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

## Getting Started

You should be able to run the app on your local machine by running the
following command:

For web: 

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

For linux:

```bash
flutter run -d linux
```

For other stuff: 

```bash
I don't know google it
```

## Assets

The `assets` directory houses images, fonts, and any other files you want to
include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware
images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware).

## Localization

This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in
the `lib/src/localization` directory.
